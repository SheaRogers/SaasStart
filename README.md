# SaasStart
A starter kit for MultiTenant Software as a Service.


## Local Development

To get started with local development on the SaasStart kit, first the Hosts file must be configured. To use the included sample tenants, the following hosts file addition will allow you to use the host based routing scheme.

```bash
127.0.0.1 default.localhost
127.0.0.1 secondary.localhost
```
